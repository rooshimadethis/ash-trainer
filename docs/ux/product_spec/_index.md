# Ash - AI-Powered Running & Training Coach

## 🎯 Vision

**Ash** is an intelligent, adaptive training companion that helps runners achieve their goals through personalized training plans, real-time adjustments, and empathetic coaching. Named after your AI coach, Ash combines cutting-edge AI with sports science to deliver a premium, futuristic training experience.

### Holistic Training Intelligence

Ash goes beyond simple workout prescriptions by tracking comprehensive data across **Running**, **Strength**, and **Mobility** to build a complete picture of your training. This enables:

*   **Gap Detection**: "You're running 4x/week but haven't done lower body strength in 10 days"
*   **Correlation Analysis**: "Your knee pain appears 2 days after heavy squats + long runs in the same week"
*   **Training Balance Validation**: "Your running volume is appropriate, but you're missing hip mobility work"
*   **Intelligent Coaching**: AI uses the complete picture to make smarter, more personalized recommendations

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic**: Slick, futuristic, yet friendly and approachable
- **Color Palette**: Consider vibrant gradients with athletic energy (e.g., electric blues, energetic oranges, deep purples)
- **Typography**: Modern, clean fonts that convey both technology and warmth
- **UI Elements**: Smooth animations, glassmorphism effects, dynamic progress indicators
- **Personality**: Ash should feel like a supportive friend who happens to be an expert coach

### User Experience Principles
1. **Adaptive Intelligence**: The app learns and adjusts to user feedback
2. **Transparent Progress**: Users always know where they stand with their goals
3. **Flexible Accountability**: Supportive pushback when needed, understanding when circumstances change
4. **Proactive Communication**: Daily check-ins and contextual notifications
