# Strength Training Philosophy - Phase 1 (MVP)

**Purpose**: Provide AI with prescription logic for runner-specific strength training using minimal, bodyweight-focused exercises that complement running without requiring gym access or complex programming.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Running-Focused**: Every exercise serves running performance or injury prevention  
**Minimal & Accessible**: 2-3 bodyweight exercises per session, no equipment required  
**Low Friction**: Designed to supplement existing routines, not replace them  
**Movement Patterns Over Isolation**: Focus on functional movements (single-leg stability, hip strength, core stability)

---

## Frequency by Pillar Priority

| Priority | Frequency | Session Duration | Prescription |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| **High** | 3-4x/week | 15-20 min | 3 exercises, 3 sets each |
| **Medium** | 2-3x/week | 10-15 min | 2-3 exercises, 2-3 sets each |
| **Low** | 1-2x/week | 10 min | 2 exercises, 2 sets each |

---

## Frequency by Goal Type

| Goal Type | Strength Frequency | Focus |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Distance Milestone** | 2x/week | Injury prevention, basic strength |
| **Time Performance** | 2-3x/week | Power production, running economy |
| **Event (Base/Build)** | 2-3x/week | Full strength program |
| **Event (Peak/Taper)** | 1-2x/week | Maintenance only, reduce volume 40% |
| **Maintenance** | 2-3x/week | Primary focus if running is low priority |

## Exercise Rotation Strategy

Ash rotates through different exercise pairs to ensure balanced development:

### **Week 1: Single-Leg Stability + Core**
- Single-Leg Glute Bridge (3x10 each side)
- Plank (3x30-45 seconds)

### **Week 2: Hip/Glute Strength + Posterior Chain**
- Clamshells (3x15 each side)
- Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (bodyweight) (3x8 each side)

### **Week 3: Plyometrics + Core** (Only for intermediate+ runners)
- Single-Leg Hops (3x8 each side)
- Bird Dogs (3x10 each side)

### **Week 4: Single-Leg Stability + Hip/Glute Strength**
- Bulgarian Split Squat (bodyweight) (3x8 each side)
- Lateral Band Walks (3x12 each direction) *or bodyweight lateral lunges if no band*

---

## Exercise Library (Phase 1 - Bodyweight Only)

### **Priority 1: Single-Leg Stability**
- Single-Leg Glute Bridge
- Bulgarian Split Squat (bodyweight)
- Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (bodyweight)
- Single-Leg Squats (assisted)

### **Priority 2: Hip & Glute Strength**
- Clamshells
- Glute Bridges (double-leg)
- Lateral Lunges
- Fire Hydrants

### **Priority 3: Core Stability**
- Plank (front, side variations)
- Bird Dogs
- Dead Bugs
- Mountain Climbers

### **Priority 4: Plyometrics** (Intermediate+ only)
- Single-Leg Hops
- Pogo Hops
- Broad Jumps
- Skater Hops

---

## Intensity Prescription

**Reps In Reserve (RIR)** approach:
- **Moderate (2-3 RIR)**: Most sets, sustainable effort
- **Hard (0-1 RIR)**: Occasional use for key sets

**Rep Ranges**:
- Strength exercises: 8-12 reps
- Core exercises: 30-45 seconds (planks) or 10-15 reps
- Plyometrics: 6-8 reps (quality over quantity)

**Sets**:
- High priority: 3 sets per exercise
- Medium priority: 2-3 sets per exercise
- Low priority: 2 sets per exercise

---

## Scheduling Rules

### **Coordination with Running**

**48-Hour Recovery Rule**: Heavy lower body strength requires 48h before key running workouts (intervals, tempo, long runs)

**Same-Day Stacking**: Light strength can be done same day as easy runs
- Run first, strength after
- Or strength in morning, easy run in evening

**Never Stack**: Don't do hard leg strength + hard running on consecutive days

### **Weekly Template Examples**

**Medium Priority (2-3x/week)**:
- **Monday**: Rest
- **Tuesday**: Intervals
- **Wednesday**: Easy Run + Strength (Upper Body + Core)
- **Thursday**: Easy Run
- **Friday**: Strength (Lower Body Focus)
- **Saturday**: Long Run
- **Sunday**: Rest or Strength (Full Body)

**Low Priority (1-2x/week)**:
- Fit in 1-2 sessions on easy run days or rest days
- Focus on injury prevention exercises (single-leg, hip/glute)

---

## Progression Logic

**Phase 1 Progression** (no equipment):
1. **Weeks 1-4**: Learn movement patterns, 2 sets
2. **Weeks 5-8**: Increase to 3 sets
3. **Weeks 9-12**: Increase reps (8 → 12)
4. **Weeks 13+**: Add tempo variations (slow eccentric, pause at bottom)

**No Equipment Needed**: All exercises use bodyweight or household items (chair for Bulgarian split squats, towel for hamstring curls)

---

## Recovery Weeks

Every 4 weeks, reduce strength volume:
- Drop to 1-2 sets per exercise (vs. 3 sets)
- Maintain intensity (same difficulty)
- Aligns with running recovery blocks

---

## Key Takeaways for AI

- **Keep it simple**: 2-3 exercises, bodyweight only
- **Rotate weekly**: Follow the 4-week rotation pattern
- **Prioritize single-leg**: Single-leg exercises are highest priority for runners
- **Schedule smart**: 48h before key runs, can stack with easy runs
- **Reduce in taper**: Drop to 1-2x/week, reduce volume 40%
