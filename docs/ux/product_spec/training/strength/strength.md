# Strength Training for Runners

Ash provides runner-specific strength training to prevent injuries, improve power production, and build structural resilience. The strength pillar complements running by targeting muscles, tendons, and movement patterns critical for running performance.

## Philosophy

**Running-Focused**: Every exercise serves running performance or injury prevention
**Equipment-Flexible**: Primarily bodyweight, with optional resistance bands/dumbbells
**Movement Patterns Over Muscle Isolation**: Focus on functional movements (single-leg stability, hip strength, core stability)

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Running-Supplemented Strength Training (MVP)

**Goal**: Help runners add running-specific exercises to their existing strength routine without being prescriptive.

#### Approach
*   **User-Led Sessions**: Users do their own strength training (gym, home workouts, classes, etc.)
*   **Ash's Contribution**: Suggests 2 runner-specific bodyweight exercises to include in each session
*   **Simple Tracking**: "Did you do a strength session today?" (Yes/No)
*   **Frequency Guidance**: Recommends 2-3 sessions per week based on goal type

#### Example Suggestions
```
💪 Strength Session Reminder

Great! Before or after your workout, try adding these 2 exercises:

1. Single-Leg Glute Bridge - 3x10 each side
   → Strengthens glutes for powerful push-off

2. Plank - 3x30 seconds
   → Core stability for better running form

These take ~5 minutes and target key running muscles.
```

#### Rotation Strategy
Ash rotates through different exercise pairs to ensure balanced development:
- **Week 1**: Single-leg stability + Core
- **Week 2**: Hip/Glute strength + Posterior chain
- **Week 3**: Plyometrics + Core
- **Week 4**: Single-leg stability + Hip/Glute strength

#### Benefits
*   **Low friction**: Doesn't require users to change their existing routine
*   **Education**: Introduces runner-specific exercises gradually
*   **Flexibility**: Works with any strength training approach (gym, CrossFit, home workouts)
*   **Foundation**: Builds awareness of running-specific needs before Phase 2

### Phase 2: Exercise Library & Detailed Tracking

**Goal**: Enable users to track individual exercises and progression.

#### Features
*   **Exercise Library**: 50-100 curated runner-specific exercises
*   **Detailed Logging**: Track sets, reps, weight (optional), RPE per exercise
*   **Flexible Sessions**: Users can log prescribed sessions OR custom gym workouts
*   **Progression Tracking**: See strength improvements over time

#### Exercise Library Structure
Each exercise includes:
*   **Name**: Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift
*   **Movement Pattern Tags**: Hip Hinge, Single-Leg, Unilateral
*   **Muscle Group Tags**: Glutes, Hamstrings, Core
*   **Equipment**: Bodyweight, Dumbbell, Kettlebell, Barbell
*   **Difficulty**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
*   **Instructions**: Text + optional video/image
*   **Running Benefit**: "Strengthens posterior chain for powerful push-off and injury prevention"

#### Tracking Interface
```
Strength Session - Custom Gym Workout

+ Add Exercise

Single-Leg RDL (Dumbbell)
Set 1: 10 reps @ 25 lbs - RPE 6
Set 2: 10 reps @ 25 lbs - RPE 7
Set 3: 8 reps @ 25 lbs - RPE 8

Bulgarian Split Squat
Set 1: 8 reps each side @ bodyweight - RPE 7
Set 2: 8 reps each side @ bodyweight - RPE 8
```

#### Benefits
*   **Detailed progression**: See weight/rep increases over time
*   **Flexibility**: Works for both prescribed sessions and custom gym workouts
*   **Data richness**: Enables Phase 3 intelligence features

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer

**Goal**: Use comprehensive tracking data to provide insights and optimize training.

#### Gap Detection
Analyze training history to identify imbalances:
*   **Movement Pattern Gaps**: "You've done 8 squat-pattern exercises but 0 hip hinges this month"
*   **Muscle Group Imbalances**: "Quad-dominant training detected. Add hamstring work."
*   **Pillar Neglect**: "No strength sessions in 10 days. Your running volume is high - injury risk increasing."

#### Correlation Analysis
Find patterns between training and outcomes:
*   **Injury Correlations**: "Your knee pain appears 2 days after heavy squats + long runs in the same week"
*   **Performance Correlations**: "You run faster on weeks with 2+ strength sessions"
*   **Recovery Patterns**: "Heavy leg days require 48h before quality running sessions"

#### Smart Scheduling
Use complete training picture to optimize scheduling:
*   **Interference Prevention**: "You did heavy squats yesterday, so today's long run is moved to tomorrow"
*   **Balance Optimization**: "You've hit all movement patterns this week except core - here's a 10min core session"
*   **Volume Management**: "Your combined running + strength volume is 15% above baseline - suggesting recovery day"

#### Progression Insights
*   **Strength Trends**: "Your single-leg squat strength has improved 40% since starting this plan"
*   **Training Balance**: "You're running more volume but doing less strength - let's rebalance"
*   **Predictive Warnings**: "This training load pattern preceded your last injury - consider a recovery week"

## Core Exercise Categories

### 1. Single-Leg Stability (Highest Priority)
Running is a series of single-leg movements. These exercises build balance, stability, and running-specific strength.

*   Single-Leg Squats / Pistol Squats
*   Single-Leg Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs)
*   Bulgarian Split Squats
*   Single-Leg Glute Bridges
*   Single-Leg Balance Holds
*   Step-Ups with Knee Drive

### 2. Hip & Glute Strength (Injury Prevention)
Strong hips and glutes prevent common running injuries (IT band syndrome, runner's knee, hip pain).

*   Glute Bridges (double and single-leg)
*   Clamshells
*   Lateral Band Walks
*   Hip Hikes
*   Fire Hydrants

## Integration with Running

### Scheduling Rules
1. **48-Hour Recovery**: Heavy lower body strength sessions require 48h before key running workouts (intervals, tempo, long runs)
2. **Same-Day Stacking**: Light strength can be done same day as easy runs (run first, strength after)
3. **Taper Protocol**: During race taper, reduce strength volume by 40-50% but maintain intensity

### Frequency by Goal Type
| Goal Type | Strength Frequency | Focus |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Distance Milestone** | 2x/week | Injury prevention, basic strength |
| **Time Performance** | 2-3x/week | Power production, running economy |
| **Event (Peak Phase)** | 1-2x/week | Maintenance only during taper |
| **Maintenance** | 2-3x/week | Primary focus, build strength base |
