# Mobility Training Philosophy - Phase 1 (MVP)

**Purpose**: Provide AI with prescription logic for runner-specific mobility work using simple dynamic and static stretches that prevent injury and improve recovery without requiring special equipment or extensive time commitment.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Injury Prevention First**: Mobility work prevents common running injuries (IT band syndrome, runner's knee, hip pain)  
**Two Types**: Active (pre-workout) and Passive (post-workout/recovery)  
**Short Sessions**: 10-30 minutes for consistency  
**Runner-Specific**: Focus on hips, ankles, calves, hamstrings, and thoracic spine

---

## Frequency by Pillar Priority

| Priority | Frequency | Session Duration | Prescription |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| **High** | 5-7x/week | 20-30 min | Daily practice, mix of active and passive |
| **Medium** | 3-5x/week | 15-20 min | Pre-run active + post-run passive |
| **Low** | 2-3x/week | 10-15 min | Post-long run passive + 1 recovery day session |

---

## Frequency by Goal Type

| Goal Type | Mobility Frequency | Focus |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Distance Milestone** | 3-4x/week | Hip mobility, ankle mobility, injury prevention |
| **Time Performance** | 3-4x/week | Dynamic mobility, pre-workout activation |
| **Event (Base/Build)** | 3-4x/week | Injury prevention, flexibility |
| **Event (Peak/Taper)** | 5-7x/week | **Increase** during taper, recovery focus |
| **Maintenance** | 4-6x/week | High priority if running is low |

## Session Types

### **Active Mobility** (10-15 min)
**When**: Before workouts or as standalone session  
**Purpose**: Movement prep, dynamic stretches, pre-run activation  
**Intensity**: Light, controlled movements

**Example Routine**:
1. Leg Swings (front/back) - 10 each leg
2. Leg Swings (side/side) - 10 each leg
3. Walking Lunges with Rotation - 10 each side
4. High Knees - 20 total
5. Butt Kicks - 20 total
6. Ankle Circles - 10 each direction, each foot
7. Hip Circles - 10 each direction

### **Passive Mobility** (15-20 min)
**When**: Post-workout or recovery days  
**Purpose**: Static stretching, foam rolling, deep tissue work  
**Intensity**: Gentle, sustained holds (30-60 seconds)

**Example Routine**:
1. Foam Roll Calves - 60 seconds each
2. Foam Roll Quads - 60 seconds each
3. Foam Roll IT Band - 60 seconds each
4. Foam Roll Glutes - 60 seconds each
5. Hip Flexor Stretch - 60 seconds each
6. Hamstring Stretch - 60 seconds each
7. Calf Stretch - 60 seconds each
8. Figure-4 Stretch (Piriformis) - 60 seconds each
9. Child's Pose - 60 seconds

### **Targeted Mobility** (10 min)
**When**: Daily, focus on problem areas  
**Purpose**: Address specific tightness or injury prevention  
**Intensity**: Moderate, focused work

**Example Routine** (Hip Focus):
1. 90/90 Hip Stretch - 60 seconds each side
2. Pigeon Pose - 60 seconds each side
3. Hip Flexor Stretch - 60 seconds each side
4. Clamshells (active mobility) - 15 each side
5. Hip Circles - 10 each direction

## Runner-Specific Focus Areas

### **Priority 1: Hip Mobility**
- Hip flexors (often tight from running)
- Glutes and external rotators
- Hip internal/external rotation
- IT band and TFL

**Key Stretches**:
- Hip Flexor Stretch (kneeling lunge)
- Pigeon Pose
- Figure-4 Stretch
- 90/90 Hip Stretch
- IT Band Foam Roll

### **Priority 2: Ankle Mobility**
- Dorsiflexion (critical for running mechanics)
- Calf flexibility
- Achilles tendon health

**Key Stretches**:
- Calf Stretch (wall or step)
- Ankle Dorsiflexion Stretch
- Ankle Circles
- Foam Roll Calves

### **Priority 3: Thoracic Spine**
- Upper back rotation
- Shoulder mobility
- Posture improvement

**Key Stretches**:
- Thoracic Rotation (quadruped)
- Cat-Cow Stretch
- Thread the Needle
- Child's Pose

### **Priority 4: Hamstring Flexibility**
- Posterior chain flexibility
- Reduce lower back strain

**Key Stretches**:
- Standing Hamstring Stretch
- Seated Hamstring Stretch
- Downward Dog
- Forward Fold

## Scheduling Rules

### **Coordination with Running**

**Pre-Run Active Mobility** (5-10 min):
- Before all key workouts (intervals, tempo, long runs)
- Optional before easy runs
- Focus on dynamic movements

**Post-Run Passive Mobility** (10-15 min):
- After all runs, especially long runs
- Focus on static stretches and foam rolling
- Longer holds (60 seconds)

**Recovery Day Deep Mobility** (20-30 min):
- 1-2x per week on rest days
- Longer holds (90 seconds)
- Full-body focus
- Restorative yoga-style session

**Taper Weeks**:
- Increase frequency to 5-7x/week
- Focus on passive recovery work
- Longer sessions (20-30 min)

### **Weekly Template Examples**

**Medium Priority (3-5x/week)**:
- **Monday**: Rest
- **Tuesday**: Active Mobility (10 min) → Intervals → Passive Mobility (15 min)
- **Wednesday**: Easy Run → Passive Mobility (10 min)
- **Thursday**: Easy Run
- **Friday**: Active Mobility (10 min) → Tempo Run → Passive Mobility (15 min)
- **Saturday**: Active Mobility (10 min) → Long Run → Passive Mobility (20 min)
- **Sunday**: Deep Mobility Session (30 min)

**Low Priority (2-3x/week)**:
- Post-long run passive mobility (15 min)
- 1 recovery day deep session (20 min)
- Optional: Quick post-run stretches (5 min)

## Progression Logic

**Flexibility Progression**:
- **Weeks 1-4**: 30-second holds, learn proper form
- **Weeks 5-8**: 60-second holds, increase range of motion
- **Weeks 9-12**: 90-second holds, add complexity (rotations, deeper stretches)

**No Volume Progression**:
- Mobility doesn't follow progressive overload
- Consistency > intensity
- Daily practice is the goal

**Depth Progression**:
- Start with comfortable range of motion
- Gradually increase depth over weeks
- Never force or bounce

---

## Equipment (Optional)

**Minimal Equipment**:
- Foam roller (or use a water bottle/rolling pin)
- Yoga mat (or towel)
- Wall or chair for balance

**No Equipment Needed**:
- All stretches can be done without equipment
- Use household items as substitutes

---

## Key Takeaways for AI

- **Two types**: Active (pre-run, dynamic) and Passive (post-run, static)
- **Short sessions**: 10-30 minutes for consistency
- **Focus areas**: Hips, ankles, calves, hamstrings, thoracic spine
- **Increase in taper**: Boost frequency to 5-7x/week during event taper
- **Daily practice**: Mobility can be done every day
- **No equipment needed**: All stretches are bodyweight or use household items
