# Running Training Plans

Ash provides tailored running training strategies based on your goal type. Each approach uses different periodization, intensity distribution, and success metrics.

## 1. Distance Milestone Goals
*Examples: "Run my first 10K", "Complete a half marathon", "Run 5 miles without stopping"*

**Philosophy:** Completion over speed. Build endurance safely and prevent injury.

### Training Approach
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Training Style** | **Time-based**: "Run for 30 minutes" (reduces pressure for beginners) |
| **Intensity Distribution** | **Pyramidal**: 75-80% Easy, 15-20% Moderate, 0-5% High |
| **Flexibility** | **High**: Skip workouts without guilt. Consistency > Perfection. |

### Phase Structure
*   **Base Phase:** 6-8 weeks of pure aerobic building
*   **Distance Familiarization:** Practice runs at 80-90% of goal distance
*   **Minimal Taper:** 7-10 days, 20-30% volume reduction
*   **Recovery Blocks:** Every 3-4 weeks, reduce volume by 20-30% (Recovery Intent)

### Key Workouts
*   **Long Runs**: Gradual duration progression
*   **Easy Aerobic Runs**: Frequency and volume building
*   **Strides**: Light pickups for neuromuscular variety

## 2. Time Performance Goals
*Examples: "Sub-30 minute 5K", "Break 2 hours in the half marathon"*

**Philosophy:** Improve speed and efficiency. Track quantifiable progress.

### Training Approach
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Training Style** | **Distance-based**: "6 × 400m intervals" (specific targets) |
| **Intensity Distribution** | **Hybrid**: Defaults to **Pyramidal** (70-80% Easy) but shifts to **Polarized** if user volume exceeds 40km/week. |
| **Flexibility** | **Medium**: Key workouts (Intervals/Tempo) are critical. |

### Phase Structure
*   **Base (4-6 wks):** Build aerobic foundation
*   **Build (4-6 wks):** Introduce race-specific intensity
*   **Peak (2-3 wks):** Highest volume + intensity
*   **Taper (1-2 wks):** Reduce volume 40-50%, maintain intensity

### Key Workouts
*   **Intervals**: Goal race pace repeats (400m-1k)
*   **Tempo Runs**: Sustained lactate threshold efforts
*   **Hill Repeats**: Power and economy building
*   **Time Trials**: Monthly benchmark testing

---

## 3. Event Goals (Race-Specific)
*Examples: "Austin Marathon on Feb 16", "NYC Half Marathon"*

**Philosophy:** Peak performance on a specific date. All training builds toward race day.

### Training Approach
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Training Style** | **Phased**: Base → Build → Peak → Taper |
| **Intensity Distribution** | Varies by phase. Peak phase has highest intensity. |
| **Flexibility** | **Low** during peak weeks. Missed workouts are not made up. |

### Taper Protocols
| Race Distance | Taper Length | Volume Reduction Protocol |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **5K** | 7-10 days | -30% W1, -50% final days |
| **10K** | 10-14 days | -30% W1, -50% W2 |
| **Half Marathon** | 2 weeks | -30% W1, -50% W2 |
| **Marathon** | 3 weeks | -20% W1, -40% W2, -60% W3 |

### Key Workouts
*   **Race Simulation**: Long runs with goal pace segments
*   **Fueling Practice**: 45-60 min fueling intervals during long runs
*   **Tune-Up Races**: Mini-tapered benchmark events

### Post-Race Recovery
Ash prescribes a mandatory recovery period after a Goal Race to ensure long-term health:
*   **5K**: 3-5 days easy/rest
*   **10K**: 5-7 days easy/rest
*   **Half Marathon**: 1-2 weeks reduced volume
*   **Marathon**: 2-4 weeks recovery (Active Recovery phase)

---

## 4. Maintenance Goals
*Examples: "Keep running 3x/week during busy season"*

**Philosophy:** Sustain fitness with minimal effective dose. Reduce pressure, increase enjoyment.

### Training Approach
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Training Style** | **Flexible scheduling**: Days are suggestions. |
| **Intensity Distribution** | **Effort-based**: Focus on feeling good. |
| **Flexibility** | **Very High**: Skip sessions without penalty. |

### Training Logic
*   **Volume**: 50-66% of previous training volume
*   **Frequency**: Maintain frequency (e.g. 4x/week) but shorten duration
*   **Key Session**: One quality session (Long run OR Interval) per week

### Success Metrics
*   Maintaining running habit
*   Enjoying runs without pressure
*   Staying injury-free

## Workout Types

All workouts are prescribed using **Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)** on a scale of 1-10.

### Easy Runs
*   **Purpose**: Aerobic base building, recovery
*   **Intensity**: RPE 3-4 (Conversational pace)
*   **Frequency**: 60-80% of weekly runs

### Long Runs
*   **Purpose**: Endurance, mental toughness
*   **Intensity**: RPE 4-5 (Comfortable, sustained effort)
*   **Frequency**: Once per week
*   **Duration**: 20-30% of weekly volume

### Tempo Runs
*   **Purpose**: Lactate threshold improvement
*   **Intensity**: RPE 6-7 ("Comfortably hard")
*   **Frequency**: Once per week (performance goals)
*   **Duration**: 20-40 minutes at tempo effort

### Intervals
*   **Purpose**: VO2 max improvement, speed
*   **Intensity**: RPE 8-10 (Very hard to maximum effort)
*   **Frequency**: Once per week (performance goals)
*   **Structure**: 400m-1600m repeats with active recovery

### Hills
*   **Purpose**: Strength, power, running economy
*   **Intensity**: RPE 8-9 (Hard effort)
*   **Frequency**: Every 2-3 weeks
*   **Structure**: 6-10 hill repeats (30-90 seconds)

### Pillar Coordination
Ash balances running, strength, and mobility based on your priority.

| Goal Type | Running Priority | Strength Priority | Mobility Priority |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Distance Milestone | High | Medium | Medium |
| Time Performance | High | Medium-High | Medium |
| Event (Race) | High | Medium (reduce in taper) | High (increase in taper) |
| Maintenance | Medium | High | High |

## 5. Protocols & Edge Cases

### Missed Workouts
*   **Distance Milestone**: Skip entirely. Consistency > Perfection.
*   **Time Performance**: Reschedule key workouts if fresh; skip easy runs. See stacking rules below.
*   **Event (Race)**: Skip in Base; Attempt light version in Build/Peak if 48h to next hard session.
*   **Maintenance**: Flexible - skip without guilt.

### Same-Day Workout Stacking
When schedule constraints require multiple workouts on the same day, follow these principles:

**Core Principle**: "Hard Days Hard, Easy Days Easy" - stacking should enhance this, not violate it.

#### ✅ Allowed Combinations
*   **Mobility + Any Workout**: Mobility enhances performance and recovery, can pair with anything
    *   Active mobility before runs/strength (5-10 min warmup)
    *   Passive mobility after runs/strength (10-15 min cooldown/stretching)
*   **Easy Run + Light Strength**: Safe if run ≤60 min and strength RPE ≤7
    *   Order: Run first, then strength (glycogen-depleted strength is safer)
    *   Avoid heavy leg exercises (squats, lunges, deadlifts) - use upper body or light core
*   **Strength + Strength**: Only if targeting different muscle groups
    *   Example: Upper body + Core, or Push + Pull

#### ❌ Prohibited Combinations
*   **2x Running Workouts**: Never schedule two runs on the same day (injury risk, excessive impact load)
*   **Hard Run + Any Strength**: Compromises quality of both sessions, excessive fatigue
*   **Heavy Leg Strength + Any Run**: Leg fatigue degrades running form and increases injury risk

#### Guidelines
*   **Prefer Separation**: When schedule allows, give each workout its own day for cleaner recovery
*   **Stack When Necessary**: Use stacking to fit volume into available days, not as default
*   **Recovery Day Protection**: During recovery blocks, only passive mobility (≤15 min) allowed
*   **Volume Constraints**: If volume doesn't fit safely, add training days or reduce session duration - never compromise safety

### Return-to-Training Coefficients
Applied to the first block back after a break to ensure a safe return.

| Duration of Break | First Block Volume | Progression Logic |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **<3 days** | 100% | Resume as planned (Minor Slide). |
| **1 week** | 75-80% | 3-day recovery ramp before resuming intensity. |
| **2 weeks** | 50-60% | 1 full week of "Base" building volume. |
| **4+ weeks** | 40-50% | Scrutinize goal (Honesty Protocol). |
| **2+ months** | 25-30% | Restart from Week 1 of Base Phase. |
